School thoughts:
  Does dudes care about looks in IM?
  Why don't they care about their looks and how they dress?
  Why do most of them have long hair and bad breath?
  Why are there so many autistic people in this school?
  Do people even have respect here? They don't even stand in a line, they just sneak.
  What kind of school is this?
